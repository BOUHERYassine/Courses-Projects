Courses-Projects, Internships

Here is a list of my courses over the last 3 years. In some courses, there are projects are mentioned in $${\color{red}red}$$

Next, I present my internship topics in detail.

### Random numerical simulation of rare events
- Monte Carlo methods : Naive, Importance Sampling and more
- $$ \textcolor{red}{\text{Prediction of a Premier League season using previous seasons and Monte Carlo methods}} $$
    - In 2015-2016, Leicester won their Premier Ligue despite being far from favourites. The bookmakers haven't even given them a 0.5% chance.
    - In our modelling of Premier Ligue, we used previous seasons to modelise the strength of a team i $V_i$. This is the **Bradley-Terry** model. In this case, when the team i faces the team j, their probability to win is $\frac{V_i}{V_i+V_j}$ (note that ties are not allowed).
    - With that, we case modelise Premier Ligue, but Leicester has a winrate of 0% when we use Naive Monte Carlo
    - We use importance sampling to modify the strenghts of the teams (the more we modify, the bigger the corrective term will be)
    - With that, we predised the chances for Leicester to Win, and it was a frequency of $10^{-4}$ 

### Statistics
- Hypothesis test
- p-value
- Statistical estimators including bias, method of moments, and EMV (Method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation)
- Introduction to Machine learning with theoretical guarantees

### Differential calculus and holomorphic functions
- Introduction to holomophic function
- Residue theorem
- Complex logarithm

### Modelling random phenomena
- Introduction to martingals, central limit theorem
- Convergence : In probability, almost surely, in $L^1$, in $L^2$, in distribution
